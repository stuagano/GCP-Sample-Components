Google Cloud Panel Demo Components
This repository presents a collection of interactive Panel components and example applications that demonstrate how to leverage Google Cloud services for creating dynamic data applications.

Features
Visualizations: Explore powerful Panel visualizations (Bokeh plots, graphs, interactive tables) connected to data stored in BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or other Google Cloud data sources.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Integrate components that utilize the Natural Language API for sentiment analysis, entity extraction, or text summarization.
Machine Learning (ML): Showcase ML models deployed on Vertex AI or AI Platform, enabling interactive prediction and analysis.
Data Exploration: Create dynamic Panel dashboards to browse, filter, and analyze data stored in BigQuery or other Google Cloud data stores.
Authentication and Authorization: Demonstrate how to secure Panel applications with Firebase Authentication or Identity Platform.

Credentials: Obtain the necessary credentials (e.g., service account key file) for the Google Cloud services you'll use. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of your credentials file.
Enable APIs: Enable the required APIs in your Google Cloud project (e.g., BigQuery API, Natural Language API, Vertex AI API).
Data: Load sample data into the relevant Google Cloud services (e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Storage) if needed.
Running the Examples
Choose an Example: Navigate to the examples directory and select an example you want to run.
Configure: Update any configuration files (e.g., config.py) with your specific project ID and credentials.
Run: Execute the Python script for the example: panel serve example_app.py
Access: Open your web browser and visit the URL indicated by the app (usually http://localhost:5006).
Examples:
bigquery_explorer.py: Interactive data exploration tool for BigQuery tables.
nlp_sentiment_app.py: Sentiment analysis of user-provided text with the Natural Language API.
vertex_ai_predictor.py: Interface for making predictions using a deployed model on Vertex AI.
firebase_auth_app.py: Panel app protected with Firebase Authentication.
