Google Cloud PyWebIO Demo Components
This repository presents a collection of interactive PyWebIO scripts and example applications that demonstrate how to leverage Google Cloud services for creating dynamic web applications without the need for extensive front-end development.

Features
Data Visualization: Build interactive visualizations directly in Python using PyWebIO, drawing data from BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or other Google Cloud data sources.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Create applications that accept text input and use the Natural Language API for sentiment analysis, entity extraction, or translation.
Machine Learning (ML): Develop user interfaces to interact with ML models deployed on Vertex AI or AI Platform, allowing users to get predictions or explore model results.
Form Handling and Input: Design custom forms with PyWebIO to gather data from users, validate input, and process it using Google Cloud services.
Realtime Updates: Utilize Pub/Sub for real-time data updates within your PyWebIO applications.

Google Cloud Setup:
Project: Create a Google Cloud project or use an existing one.
Credentials: Obtain the necessary credentials (e.g., service account key file) for the Google Cloud services you'll use. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of your credentials file.
Enable APIs: Enable the required APIs in your Google Cloud project (e.g., BigQuery API, Natural Language API, Vertex AI API).
Data: Load sample data into the relevant Google Cloud services (e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Storage) if needed.
Running the Examples
Choose an Example: Navigate to the examples directory and select an example you want to run.
Configure: Update any configuration files (e.g., config.py) with your specific project ID and credentials.
Run: Execute the Python script for the example: python example_app.py
Access: Open your web browser and visit the URL indicated by the app (usually http://localhost:8080).
Examples:
bigquery_charts.py: Create interactive charts based on BigQuery data.
nlp_sentiment_tool.py: Real-time sentiment analysis tool for text input.
vertex_ai_prediction_ui.py: User-friendly interface to interact with a Vertex AI model for predictions.
pubsub_chat.py: Real-time chat application powered by Pub/Sub.
