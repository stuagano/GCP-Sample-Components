Google Cloud Dash Demo Components
This repository provides a collection of interactive Dash components and example applications that demonstrate how to leverage Google Cloud services to build powerful, data-driven web applications.

Features
Visualizations: Explore various Dash visualization components (graphs, charts, maps) connected to data stored in BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or other Google Cloud data sources.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Integrate components that use the Natural Language API for sentiment analysis, entity recognition, or text classification.
Machine Learning (ML): Showcase models deployed on Vertex AI or AI Platform and create interactive components to get predictions.
Data Analytics: Build dashboards and reports with Dash that access data stored in BigQuery and allow users to explore and filter it dynamically.
Authentication and Authorization: Demonstrate how to secure your Dash apps using Firebase Authentication or Identity Platform.

Google Cloud Setup:

Project: Create a Google Cloud project or use an existing one.
Credentials: Obtain the necessary credentials (e.g., service account key file) for the Google Cloud services you'll use. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of your credentials file.
Enable APIs: Enable the required APIs in your Google Cloud project (e.g., BigQuery API, Natural Language API, Vertex AI API).
Data: Load sample data into the relevant Google Cloud services (e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Storage) if needed.
Running the Examples
Choose an Example: Navigate to the examples directory and select an example app you want to run.

Configure:  Update any configuration files (e.g., config.py) with your specific project ID and credentials.

Run: Execute the Python script for the example: python example_app.py

Access:  Open your web browser and visit the URL indicated by the app (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050).

Examples
bigquery_dashboard.py: Interactive dashboard pulling data from BigQuery.
nlp_sentiment_analysis.py: Text input for sentiment analysis using the Natural Language API.
vertex_ai_prediction.py: Get predictions from a deployed model on Vertex AI.
firebase_authentication.py: Secure your Dash app with Firebase Authentication.
